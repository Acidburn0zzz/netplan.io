          <dt>How do I bring interfaces up or down?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>While we recommend that people do not change the state of network interfaces without a good reason and simply let the renderer configured in netplan handle the network interfaces it is meant to configure, you can always modify interface settings manually via the <strong>ip</strong> command.</p>
            <p>To bring up an interface:</p>
            <pre><code>ip link set eth0 up</code></pre>
            <p>To bring and interface down:</p>
            <pre><code>ip link set eth0 down</code></pre>
            <p>See man ip for more information on how you can manipulate the state of network interfaces.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>How can I look up the currently applied addresses for my system?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Netplan is only meant to translate configuration into the appropriate files for the backend you want to use. It does not display IP information by itself, since it does not manage those by itself.</p>
            <p>You can always get the most accurate state of the IP addresses for your system using the ip addr command.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>How do I configure a single interface with netplan so it works now and at next boot?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>To achieve this you must write a simple netplan configuration file, such as this:</p>
            <pre><code>
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      dhcp4: true
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>Then save this to a file under <code>/etc/netplan</code> with a .yaml extension.</p>
                  <p>Finally, run netplan apply. This will enable DHCP on the eth0 interface, and immediately attempt to get a new IP address for it. Since the file is written to disk, the same rule will be applied at boot time.</p>
                  <p>To configure the interface for a static IP address, you could instead use:</p>
                  <pre><code>
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      addresses:
        - 10.10.10.2/24
      dhcp4: no
          </code></pre>
              <p>Simply write under addresses the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) you want assigned to the interface, along with its prefix length. On many networks, /24 is the prefix length you want.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>How do I unconfigure a single interface with netplan so it stops and remains unconfigured at next boot?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Simply remove the configuration for it. If the interface is not configured in a .yaml file in <code>/etc/netplan</code>, it will not be configured at boot.</p>
            <p>To retain connectivity while you configure interfaces, IP addresses are not removed from interfaces when you run <code>netplan apply</code>. To remove addresses manually, you can use <code>ip address del &lt;address&gt; dev &lt;interface&gt;</code>.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>How can I add pre-up, post-up, etc. hook scripts?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>While the netplan configuration does not include support for hook scripts, you can add systemd unit jobs with the appropriate Requires: and After: fields to run arbitrary commands once the network is up.</p>
            <p>The same is possible with <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a> by writing a script watching for the right event in <code>/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d</code>. See the <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NetworkManager">NetworkManager</a>(8) manpage for details.</p>
          </dd>
          <dt>I currently use Openvswitch ifupdown declarations and would like to replicate this on 18.04, how can I do that?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>Openvswitch support requires the use of hook scripts. You would need to write a systemd unit that runs ovs_vsctl correctly for your particular setup.</p>
            <p><pre><code>#example systemd unit</code></pre></p>
          </dd>
          <dt>I really do need ifupdown, can I still use it?</dt>
          <dd>
            <p>If you run into a case where you do need to use ifupdown instead of netplan, we would really like to know about it, so you should <a href="http://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nplan/+filebug">file a bug in Launchpad</a>.</p>
            <p>While we don't recommend doing so, you can remove netplan and install ifupdown after install, and fill in <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> manually to configure your network the way you want it.</p>
            <p>You can also opt to use ifupdown instead of netplan at installation by preseeding <code>netcfg/do_not_use_netplan=true</code> (adding it the the command-line when you boot the Ubuntu Server installation media, in grub (when you see the menu hit "e" to edit; or in the bootsplash by hitting F6). This will fallback to installing ifupdown and configuring it for the network devices set up during the installation.</p>
